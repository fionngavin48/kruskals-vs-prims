# kruskals-vs-prims

A Python simulation to compare the speeds of Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for pathfinding the minimum spanning tree of the same network.

This project visualizes a randomly generated network graph and implements Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). The program also measures and compares the execution time of both algorithms.

# Features

Generates a random graph with nodes and weighted edges.

Visualizes the graph using Pygame.

Implements Kruskal's and Prim's MST algorithms.

Compares execution time for performance analysis.

# Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies:

'pip install pygame'

# How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/fionngavin48/kruskals-vs-prims.git

cd kruskals-vs-prims

Run the Python script:

python main.py

# Example Output

Kruskal's Algorithm Time: 0.000120 seconds
Prim's Algorithm Time: 0.000150 seconds
